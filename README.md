## User Story
As a consumer who enjoys streaming music, I want an application that allows me to listen to music while directly supporting the artists I enjoy so that I can get my music fix while funding artists instead of corporations.

As an artist/musician/band, I want a service that allows me to not only cut out the distribution middlemen that eat away at my profit (CDBaby, Tunecore, etc), but also allows my fans to directly support what I create, so that I can continue doing what I love and make money in the process.


## Description
A digital music streaming platform designed with listeners and artists in mind.


## Technologies Utilized
React.js, MongoDB, Atlas, Mongoose AWS S3, Express, Stitch, Stripe, Node.js
